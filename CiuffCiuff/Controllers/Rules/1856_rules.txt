@bFloat: @ncurrent train value * 10%
@l
@bBuilding tracks: @nsemi-permissive
@l
@bStock Round:
@nSell -> Buy / Buy -> Sell (can't sell any share bought the same exact turn)
Cannot sell in the first stock round
Brown section: may go over 60% (but one share at a time)
@l
@nincremental capitalization (for first 5 shares),
then money are locked in bank until company reaches its destination city
if company is started when 5-trains available -> incremental capitaliazione for all shares
if company is started when 6-trains available -> full capitaliazione
@l
@nSELL -> Drop one space per share sold (5% does not drop)
@l
@bOperating Round:
@n- each company may take a 100$ loan once per OR anytime (90$ if taken after pay interests phase)
- each company pays 10$ interests for each loan it has
(if comp cannot, it uses money from train-run income, then president's emergency)
- @umax number of loans = number of shares in players' hands
@n(if company exceeds at end of OR comp must redeem loans in excess)
@l
@nTrains count the number of stops
@l
@bPHASE 5 (purchase of 6-train):
@nall loans must be repaid
(if any company fails to do so, CGR is formed)
if none of forming companies has operated CGR operates immediately (otherwise waits next OR)
@l
@ntowns may be:
upgraded (from single town to Yellow single city)
upgraded (from double town to Green double city)
downgraded (from single town to Yellow single road)
downgraded (from double town to Green double road)
@l
@nport token is removed
@l
@bCGR Formation (when first 6-train bought):
@nall comps must repay all loans (starting with president who bought train then clockwise)
president may contribute with personal cash but cannot force emergency sale
@l
@nif all companies repay all loans -> CGR does not form
@l
@nCGR Formation: 2x absorbed share -> 1x CGR share
president is player with max number of CGR shares
(if player has only 1 share, it must buy a single CGR share in following SR (can force emergency), unless another player reaches 20% CGR before)
CGR absorb all station markers of forming companies
(max 10 stations, must replace all if possible, other stations cost 100$)
CGR inherits all trains from forming companies (must keep permanents but president may discard non-permanent trains)
if CGR has no train it may borrow a diesel, but continue withholding (share value does not move) until it may buy a permanent train (CGR can "wait" and buy diesel, it is not forced to buy 6-train)
treasury = sum of treasury of forming companies (that's it)
share value is 100$ or average of share value of forming companies (whichever is higher)
@l
@nAfter purchase of first 6-train: certificate limit becomes dynamic (based on the number of open companies)
@bGAME END:
@nbank or player bankruptcy
(if CGR not formed and some companies have still loans, their share values is decreased by 10$ each loan)
@b8-trains variant:
@nInstead of playing with Diesel, you can play with 8-trains (since Diesel trains were not popular at that time)
