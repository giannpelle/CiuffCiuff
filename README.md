This repo contains the source code for a mobile app I developed in order to handle money and operations for a variety of 18xx board games.
The app is writte in swift (native) and is available for iPad only.

The board games currently supported are the following:
- 1830
- 1840
- 1846
- 1848
- 1849 (with variants)
- 1856
- 1882
- 1889
- 18Chesapeake (with Off the rails expansion)
- 18MEX
  
and more to come in the future!


Here are some screenshots of the app:
